  ```sh
  python==3.9.19
  ```

### Installation

You can use pip to install the required packagess.

  ```sh
  pip install requirements.txt -r
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* Forward Model
  
  You can find the forward model in the forward_model_0919.ipynb. The forward model predicts the target property (yield strength) of polymers based on their structural representation. It is a critical component of RLPolyG, enabling property evaluation during the reinforcement learning process.

* Inverse Model
  
  The inverse model aims to generate polymers with specified properties. You can find the inversw model in the RLPolyG_final.ipynb.
  1. Unbiased Generation Model: The inverse model is initially trained using the PI1M dataset to generate polymers without property bias. This model learns the underlying polymer structure distribution.
  2. Biased Generation Model: The ReLease algorithm is then applied to refine the model for property-biased generation. Reinforcement learning is used to guide the model toward generating polymers with the desired properties, such as high yield strength.

* Screening for Synthetic Accessibility and Degradability
  
  1. Synthetic Accessibility: You can find the related model in the SA score folder.
  2. Degradability: You can find the related model in the Degradability folder. We first collected degradability data from Yuan et al.â€™s work. Using this data, we constructed a random forest model to predict the degradability score of the generated polymers, which also took MFF as input features.
