# RLPolyG
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is the code for **De Novo Design of Polymers with Specified Properties Using Reinforcement Learning**.


### Prerequisites

The version of python:

  ```sh
  python==3.9.19
  ```

### Installation

You can use pip to install the required packagess.

  ```sh
  pip install requirements.txt -r
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The forward model predicts the target property (yield strength) of polymers based on their structural representation. It is a critical component of RLPolyG, enabling property evaluation during the reinforcement learning process.
